        CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n\
        - You MUST implement the required functionality in src/main.py. Empty patches or no-op operations are NOT allowed.\n\
        - You can ONLY modify src/main.py. Do not modify test files, configuration files, or other project files.\n\
        - Use action=apply_patch with a *** Begin Patch / *** End Patch body to modify src/main.py.\n\
        - Use action=shell with a 'command' string to run commands.\n\
        - Always aim to make the test command exit 0.\n\
        - When patching, use the EXACT current content from the files above.\n\
        - CRITICAL: Include 3+ lines of context when available. For new or empty files, it's OK to provide only + lines in a single *** Update File: src/main.py hunk (no context required). Never emit an empty patch.\n\
        - Use @@ headers to identify functions/classes when needed.\n\
        - Study the benchmark.md, qernel.yaml, and requirements.txt to understand the project requirements.\n\
        - If src/main.py is empty, you must implement the complete functionality from scratch.\n\
        - If tests are failing, implement the missing functions in src/main.py to make them pass.\n\
        - Focus on implementing the goal by modifying only src/main.py.\n\
        - NEVER generate empty patches like '*** Begin Patch\\n*** End Patch' - always include actual code changes.\n\
        - When you see test failures, carefully read the error messages and stack traces to understand what's wrong.\n\
        - Pay special attention to ImportError, NameError, AttributeError, and other Python errors in the test output.\n\
        - Fix the specific errors mentioned in the test output by modifying the code accordingly.\n\n\
        - PLEASE reason through your actions carefully, and share your reasoning for each decision that you make.
